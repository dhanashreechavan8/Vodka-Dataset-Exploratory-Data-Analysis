# Vodka-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

#### This data was originally published by the State of Iowa and has been republished as-is on Kaggle.

#### This data is a representative sample of sale activity for alcohol in the United States, and can be used to answer many questions thereof, like: how much alcohol is sold and consumed in the United States? What kind? What are the most popular brands and labels? What are the most popular mixers? What is the distribution of prices paid in-store?

#### In this dataset I have:
1. Imported the dataset
2. Checked duplicate values
3. Checked frequency distribution of attributes
4. Dropped unnecesssary columns
5. Handled missing values using different Imputation techniques
6.
