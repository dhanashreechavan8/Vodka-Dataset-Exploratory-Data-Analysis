# Vodka-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

#### This data was originally published by the State of Iowa and has been republished as-is on Kaggle.

#### This data is a representative sample of sale activity for alcohol in the United States, and can be used to answer many questions thereof, like: how much alcohol is sold and consumed in the United States? What kind? What are the most popular brands and labels? What are the most popular mixers? What is the distribution of prices paid in-store?

**Technology used:** Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook

#### In this dataset I have:
1. Imported the dataset
2. Checked duplicate values
3. Checked frequency distribution of attributes
4. Dropped unnecesssary columns
5. Handled missing values using different Imputation techniques
6. Checked summary statistics of numerical variables
7. Performed exploratory data analysis

Once the dataset was cleaned, I answered following business questions:

Question 1:
How are the Vodka Sales changing throughout the years?

Question 2:
Which counties have the highest vodka sales?

Question 3:
Which counties have highest profit for the sold Vodka?

Question 4?
